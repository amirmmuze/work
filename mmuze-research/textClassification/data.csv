customer support,"Hello, I attended a counter today following a trial of foundation which I have totally loved and decided to purchase. At the counter I explained this and said that I couldn’t remember which type of foundation it was but I remember that it was a 9. She asked me when I had the trial and I said about 2 weeks ago so she said it will be the new one to which I said that I knew it was not the new one as I don’t like a shine. She said that 9 seemed too dark for me and said that it was this one selecting beyond perfecting then took it straight to the till and rang it through. I said can I check as I don’t want a thick foundation but a light medium cover that controls oil. She told me to “just use less” I went on to ask about buying something else to obtain the free bag but she just pointed to the card machine. I paid and left. I’m now home and this is definitely not the foundation I need as it is the wrong colour and certainly too thick please can you help?"

customer support,Last Saturday I have purchased a super balance foundation. I have been using stay matt but now my skin is more combination than oily. I have advice the consultant the shade I have been using and I have trusted her to match as closely as possible. At home the shade looked very dark. I assumed that maybe a lighting in my bedroom making look darker then it is. Only when people started to comment that my face look tanned more than rest of my body I realise that it must be too dark for me. I have since compared with my shade that I have used previously and its a lot different
customer support,Myself and three friends have bought you high impact lipstick in After Party for years it was the perfect colour why dis continue it when even make up artists on numerous clinique counters said it always sold out quick dry
customer support,ok so when I go to the shop I don't have to pay anything?

customer support,"OK, well, I'd like this completed by you or your partner company; I paid by credit card so the money is already in your or their account. I am not well enough to go through the whole process again, so please authorize that this is completed on myh behalf immediately."

customer support,She bought a clinique kit in the summer in duty free when we were on holidays but I didn't look carefully enough to see which kit it was lol.
customer support,thank you the assistant said it was a great cream just nervous as I have sensitive eyes. No problem about the confusion. I will sign off now - thank you
customer support,"Thank you again, Jennifer! I will surely contact you again if I have more questions."
customer support,Thank you very much Lisa for your support
customer support,Sorry I couldn’t see your message about contacting head office through email
customer support,"thanks for your advise ,ill probably go to a counter rather than risk paying for one and it not being right ,,thankyou"
customer support,Thank you. I bought a 3 step kit but I'm wondering how long it takes until dry patch time?
customer support,"Thank you - bought products from the duty free shop at the channel tunnel (in a rush as very stressed), I asked for the lightest colour as no testers available. After I paid over £50 & left the terminal, discovered she had given me shade 4!!! Much too dark for my skin & unusable."
customer support,there is a code for next day delivery
customer support,"That helps, thanks - does the refund apply to opened and tested products?"
customer support,"Yes that is true, i really could not track stores you have mentioned only by googling, one should specifically type the store name"
customer support,Thank you. I bought the blackhead solutions extractor yesterday but I’m not sure which stage in my 3 step I am supposed to use it
customer support,"Thank you for your help, i will contact them and chat to them. Truro is a better journey than to Plymouth. Goodbye!"
customer support,OK.. How much would I pay for thursday delivery?
customer support,Payday treats
customer support,"then for a few days, they have really irritated my eyes. Would I be able to take them back to the counter for a refund?"
customer support,"Yes, that''s why I opted for your 'live chat' support."
customer support,Thats why i needed help from an expert.. so i know i got the right products
customer support,Thank you. If you've got time I also fancy a new lipstick. I'm currently wearing your long lasting in pink moon and love it but fancied something a bit more red but not bright red.
customer support,Recently I bought yellow moisturizer
customer support,"Well, i bought a powder from air spun at christmas but it’s really shows off my spots, i’m not sure whether it’s that powder or my foundation and i really want something to cover them better, any tips?"

customer support,very fair- fair but not moderate but not very very fair..lol

customer support,Since I bought that serum costing me £62
customer support,whats your delivery time usually?
customer support,On the2nd NOVEMBER. I contacted Clinique 2 days before the 30th November as it still hadn't arrived. I was told by clinique it had been delivered - but alas it had not. They were going to contact GPO andante back to me.
customer support,So how much would delivery cost?
customer support,"week, if the product dont give me result will you accept them back and refund my money?? this is available at stores"
customer support,sorry i can't call during the day which is why i contacted oyu on live chat
customer support,Once through Paypal and once through my visa card as it said there was a problem with paypal
customer support,will they give me my refund
customer support,"So I purchased the cleanser, clarifier, clearing treatment and anti blemish bb"
customer support,thanks again I will contact them tomorrow
customer support,"So I sort of just need to know either way, I never usually have to wait this long to know when to expect my delivery with any other company"
customer support,Out of interest when was this parcel dispatched by clinique. I was told on Monday it would be next day delivery as I had explained on that call that I needed to have the item before today
customer support,would they do that....i don't want to get the assistant in to any bother but it really is not a good match for my skin.
customer support,Sorry phone playing up and getting kids bathed at the same time! Ok I found the liner. Yeah I wanted to switch to Clinique for those reasons so I was surprised my eyes get aggravated. The only one I can use is Bobbi brown gel liner but it’s not easy to pick up where I moved to. Clinique is sold down the road and I’d love to switch brands but reluctant until I can find a liner that is going to work... I bought the quick liner for eyes....
customer support,So I’m new to Clinique and two days ago bought the brush set and serum gift set
customer support,So I don't need to pay for it
customer support,this is absolutely appalling customer service
customer support,"Yes I did, thank you. Will the store refund my money?"
customer support,This is why I was so unhappy. I bought the foundation and powder I needed but I wanted help with my full makeup.
customer support,so in short my mum bought me some clinique foundation
customer support,Yes I think so but I really don’t want to pay twice
customer support,So today I got the blackhead solution the scrub and the extractor. I'm just enquiring how I use the extractor? Do I use it with my 3 step products
customer support,thank you. If it's incorrect and I buy online can she send back if unused?

customer support,Very disappointed with my makeup appointment today. I booked a full makeup tutorial for 45 mini online. I went to Birmingham House if Fraser with no makeup on. The Clinique counter did not know I was coming. It was really busy and only one attendant on the counter. I only got my foundation matched to my skin.

Thank you so much for all your help!"

customer support,"Thank you so much. I will take a look at both of them, if I don’t find that either or one feel any better, do you do a refund on opened bottles?"

customer support,What's the number? And on my email or on the parcel?
customer support,"Yes I have, besides, it's for my daughter and she would have told and thanked me if she had received it. I sent an Gift because I thought it would be a swift delivery!"
customer support,That’s ok I shall take a look a little later as I don’t get paid until tonight :)

customer support,Thank you. That is not bad for £10 and free delivery?
customer support,The customer service is not helpful
customer support,Yes. I'll try again. I just didn't want to do it then get it refunded again as it takes so long for the refund to go through. Thank you for checking.
customer support,"Yes, it really does, but I have a very fussy daughter and I am on a mission from my son in law to track down the lip balm crayons. Do you know if they would still be available in store?"
customer support,What's the earliest delivery we can d?
customer support,will I have to pay for the phone call?
customer support,Thank you. I’ve contacted them on one other occasion about a reaction and they were very helpful and sourced me the correct product but I would feel embarrassed to do it again. Are there any online promotions currently?
customer support,You didn't give me a number you told me to contact house of Fraser!!! I have the screen shot
customer support,That will be great thank you or i did actually go buy another one as was for a Christmas present so if it's the same I could just get it refunded but if it's easier to send another one I will do that
